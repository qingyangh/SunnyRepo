Today, my Applied Materials adventure comes to a close. I have been working with a group of talented and hardworking people in the past 30 years and have learned a lot.

My next adventure will be more family focused spending time with my new wife, traveling to visit my daughters and my parents, siblings and friends.

My personal email is qingyangh@yahoo.com.

I wish Applied Materials the best and thank you all for all the memories.
